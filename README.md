# Spotify Login Tester

## Description

This project is a simple automated test suite designed to validate the login functionality of the Spotify application. The test suite includes scenarios for logging in with different credentials: empty, incorrect and correct.

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Credential Testing
The application allows testing with three distinct sets of credentials:

Empty Credentials: Evaluates the response when both the username and password fields are left empty.
Incorrect Credentials: Assesses the behavior when incorrect username and password combinations are provided.
Correct Credentials: Verifies the login process with valid username and password credentials.

### 2. Real-time Feedback
During the testing process, users receive real-time feedback on the outcome of each login attempt. Whether it's an error message indicating invalid credentials or a successful login confirmation, the application ensures clarity in understanding the results.

### 3. Flexible and Customizable
Built with flexibility in mind, the application can be easily customized to accommodate additional testing scenarios or specific requirements. Whether you need to extend functionality, integrate with other systems, or adapt to changes in the Spotify authentication process, the codebase is well-structured and easily extensible.

### 4. Open Source
The Spotify Login Tester is open-source software, licensed under the MIT License. This means you have the freedom to modify, distribute, and contribute to the project as per your requirements.
